PREFERENCES->INPUT-CONTROLLERS: 
zooming

TOOLS:
pixel pencil, selection, eraser -> dynamics, anti-aliasing, hard edge
colour picker -> sample merged

DOCKABLE DIALOGS:
TR->navigation
CR->layers
BR->colours (with selected palette)
C->(view->grid, image->configure-grid)
TL->tools
BL->tool-options
OPTIONAL->(view of reference image)

WORKFLOW:
draw new objects (shadows 2) into own transparent filled layer

USEFUL:
preferences->window-management->save-window-options
preferences->tool-options->save-tool-options
right angled triangles in direction of light for shadows

MOVING SELECTION: ctrl-shift-f->ctrl-r
COPYING LAYER: alt-shift-drag->ctrl-shift-a
SELECT BY COLOUR: shift-o

decide on orientation. connect with modified line angles and basic shapes. can taper off.
????connecting horizontal lines to vertical lines????

can lighten darker side (due to light position) by putting a surface on this side that will reflect light back onto this side (it will have the same colour as the surface)
shadows will be perpendicular to light source (use right angled triangle to calculate position)
